## **Introduction**

In academic learning, the availability of past question papers and verified solutions plays a crucial role in exam preparation. Traditionally, students rely on physical copies of question papers, which are often difficult to find, scattered across various sources, or unverified. Colleges, on the other hand, face challenges in managing and distributing these papers efficiently.

The **Previous Year Paper Provider platform** addresses these challenges by providing a **centralized, digital solution** for both students and colleges. It leverages **AI technology** to provide accurate solutions to past papers and recommends **relevant YouTube lectures** based on the topics of the papers.

The system is designed with a **full-stack architecture**, where the frontend built using **React.js** and **Tailwind CSS** communicates with the backend developed in **Node.js and Express.js**. Data is securely stored in **MongoDB**, and **JWT tokens** ensure secure, role-based access for users, colleges, and administrators.

The platform has three distinct roles:

1. **User (Student):** Can register, login, download question papers, and access AI-generated solutions and lecture suggestions.
2. **College:** Can register, upload, update, and delete question papers after admin verification.
3. **Admin:** Manages verification of colleges, monitors paper uploads, and ensures secure and proper usage of the system.

This project not only **simplifies access to educational resources** but also helps students understand exam patterns, identify key topics, and prepare efficiently. The integration of AI ensures that solutions are accurate, while the recommended video lectures provide additional learning support.

The system is also **scalable**, allowing future enhancements such as adding analytics, mobile apps, live chat support, and advanced AI models to further improve the learning experience.
